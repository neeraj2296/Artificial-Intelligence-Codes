# Online Shopping

<br/>


This dataset has data of customers who buys clothes online. The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company wants to estimate the yearly amount of money spent by a user based on certain parameters.

The parameters included are :

- Email
- Address
- Avatar
- Avg. Session Length
- Time on App
- Time on Website
- Length of Membership
- Yearly Amount Spent (what we want to predict)

Use of Multivariable Linear Regression to predict the chance of admissions.
